        <p class="lead">Marvel Comics is the common name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc,
           formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, an American publisher of comic books 
           and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's
           parent company.

        <p class="lead">Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become 
           known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four 
           and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Captain America,
           Spiderman, Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Deadpool, Wolverine, Daredevil, Ms. Marvel, 
           and Ant-Man, such teams as the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Inhumans, S.H.I.E.L.D.,
            the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, and antagonists such as Venom, Doctor Doom, Red Skull, Green 
            Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor Octopus, Magneto and Loki. Most of Marvel's fictional characters
